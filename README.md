# Welcome Screen Template
A simple Android app template with a welcome screen/slider to introduce the app.
## Screenshots
Below are some assorted screenshots:

## Setting Up
To set this up,
* Edit the strings in `res/values/strings.xml`
* Change the app colors in `res/values/colors.xml`
* Change the package from `org.zaneweb.welcomescreentemplate` to your package name.
* Change the content of HomeActivity to whatever you like. It is the activity that will be launched on startup (after welcome screen)
* Add your app code, activities, icons, images, etc.
